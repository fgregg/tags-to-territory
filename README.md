Estimate territories from gang tags

From flickr and Open311 we can get a stream of geo-located images of graffiti in Chicago. 
Right now 10-20 a day, and wil ramp up significantly as open311 diffuses. 
Many of these images are gang tags. 

* If the stream has enough geographical coverage,
* and if the we can identify the gangs associated with an image of a tag

Then we may be able to get an estimate of geographic concentration of gang activity. This also depends upon the
additional assumptions that 

* Nearly all gangs engage in tagging
* That there are more likely to be gang tags within an area where gangs are activity

We would need people to label the images. How do we do this?
